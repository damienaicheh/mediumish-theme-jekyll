#### Generate a table of content

```yaml
toc: true # Add this on the property of your post
```

#### Example of source code displayed

```html
<li class="ml-1 mr-1">
    <a target="_blank" href="#">
    <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>
    </a>
</li>
```

#### Add a note

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

Use a prefix before your sentence:

```html
>
```

#### Highlight some text

`gem install bundler` installs the bundler gem through RubyGems. You only need to install it once - not every time you create a new Jekyll project...

To do it just use:
```html
`Your word(s) in back quote`
```

### Blur some text

The mind-warping film opened with a hospital patient Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) awakening in a <span class="spoiler"> hospital with little knowledge (amnesia perhaps?) of what had happened, and why he was there, etc. He was told by attending Dr. Jeremy Newman (Stephen Rea) that it was July 29, 2002 (Simon thought it was the year 2000 - he was confused - he heard a doctor say 20:00 hours!) and that he had died for two minutes from cardiac arrest following the near-fatal accident -- but he had been revived ("You're as good as new").</span> Dr. Newman: "Simon, this is the 29th of July. The year is 2002. And your wife, whose name is Anna, is waiting outside." 

To use it just add the `span` tag with the `spoiler` class to wrapp your text:

```html
Text before <span class="spoiler">My hidden paragraph here.</span>
```
